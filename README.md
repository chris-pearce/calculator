# JavaScript Calculator

In an effort to get better at JavaScript and ES6 I built a calculator under the mentoring of [Dave Berner](http://davidberner.co.uk/).

The calculator is a simple four function calculator and is modeled of the **Basic** variation of the OS X calculator. Please log any bugs [here](https://github.com/chris-pearce/calculator/issues) 👍.

I’ve done my best to make this calculator accessible as accessibility on the Web is important to me. I’d love to hear of any things I’ve missed or suggestions for improvement. 

As a sort of fun experiment I used CSS viewport units for the entire calculator UI so it’ll _always_ take up the entire width and height of your viewport. I was tempted to put a `max-width` on the calculator but thought ‘what the heck’ let it keep going. So launch it on your smart TV and see the world’s largest on-screen calculator 😄.
