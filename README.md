# Calculator

A simple full viewport calculator built with ES6.

In an effort to get better at JavaScript and ES6 I built a calculator under the mentoring of @DaveOrDead.

This calculator doesn't possess the entire suite of functionality a standard calculator has, who knows one day it might, but the basics should be down pat, or at least I hope they are (please log bugs here: https://github.com/chris-pearce/calculator/issues üëç).

Just for shits and giggles I used CSS viewport units for the entire calculator UI so it'll _always_ take up the entire width and height of your viewport. I
was tempted to put a `max-width` on the calculator but thought 'f#ck it' let
the sucker keep going‚Ä¶ so open it on your smart TV or even better a projector and see the world's largest on-screen calculator.
