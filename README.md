# JavaScript Calculator

In an effort to get better at JavaScript and ES6 I'm building a calculator under the mentoring of [Dave Berner](http://davidberner.co.uk/). See the [Issues](https://github.com/chris-pearce/javascript-calculator/issues) section to see what‚Äôs left to do.

The calculator is a simple four function calculator and is modeled of the **Basic** variation of the OS X calculator. Please log any bugs [here](https://github.com/chris-pearce/javascript-calculator/issues) üëç.

I‚Äôll be doing my best to make this calculator accessible as accessibility on the Web is important to me. 

As a sort of fun experiment I used CSS viewport units for the entire calculator UI so it‚Äôll _always_ take up the entire width and height of your viewport. I was tempted to put a `max-width` on the calculator but thought ‚Äòwhat the heck‚Äô let it keep going. So launch it on your smart TV and see the world‚Äôs largest on-screen calculator üòÑ.
